## Status

Webinizer and Webinizer-client is a BETA project and is not yet fully production ready, although we
encourage usage and experimentation. Support bandwidth is limited, and we will focus on well
documented [issues], ideally with test cases. We always welcome contributions, for more detail see
[CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md). Caveat Emptor.
